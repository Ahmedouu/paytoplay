# seamlessPayments

A DApp powered by aptos, it aims to provide a seamless, transparent, and efficient platform for real-time financial transactions, offering users full control and visibility over their payment streams

Claiming APT: As soon as a stream begins, the recipient has the freedom to claim the amount that has been streamed up to that point at any time they choose.

Viewing stream rate: Users involved in sending or receiving streamed payments have the ability to monitor their current stream rate, which reflects their total stream rate, taking into account all incoming and outgoing payments.

Managing streams: The platform equips users with comprehensive control over their incoming and outgoing payment streams.

Viewing stream history: Users have the option to look back at the history of each individual stream they are involved in, whether they are sending or receiving.


The .env includes a deployed contract address on the aptos testnetwork.
# Deploying the dapp locally:

1. Navigate to the app directory
2. Run yarn install or npm install to install dependencies
3. Run yarn dev or npm run dev to start the development server
4. Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result

The DAPP will walk you through how to use it, but the main thing to remember here is that you need a wallet (Martian or Petra) and at least two different accounts, create a payment stream between two accounts, accept payments, cancel payments, claim payments, view your payment history, keep watching your payement stream rate and enjoy :)
